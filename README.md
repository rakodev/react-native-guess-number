This is my first React Native application build with Expo.

### Prerequisites to run this application on your machine

- NodeJs
  - https://nodejs.org/en/
- Expo

  - `sudo npm install expo-cli --global`

- To run the application on a simulator
  - If you're on Mac you have to install `Xcode`
  - If you're on Windows you can install `Android Studio`

### Then run the project with

- npm start
  - `w` option opens the Web version in the browser.
  - `i` option opens the iOS version.
  - `a` option opens the Android version.
